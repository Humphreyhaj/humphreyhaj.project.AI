Final project for the Building AI course

ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIR SYSTEM

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 

It's no surprise that with advancement of technology, there's need for faster and efficient ways for disable to move around. Introduction of electric wheelchair brought all that but with some setbacks. My idea is to create a wheelchair which is more efficient in it's electric usage and able to go more mileage by regenerating it's own power which propels it further. Being disabled in a world where things seem to go fast, we need to keep up with it. Electric wheelchairs are a darling. It's easier to go up ramps, go long distances without getting tired cause the systems efficient.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
MANOUVRE ALL TERRAINS
Electric wheelchairs however much good, one short-coming is that it's only good on certain terrains. It's good on flat paths and bumpy on rugged grounds. I want to create a wheelchair that will be effient on all terrains purposed to be suitable on all terrains so that a isable dperson can easily access all areas where one needs to be.

* problem 2
GO LONGER DISTANCES
Electric wheelchairs go as far as there b\ttery can hold. Mostly that's barely 10 km a day which limit range of one. A common inconvenience is it can seize to move at a place where one leasts expects it hence one becomes stranded. With my new invention or remodification, it seeks to make use of the mechanical energy produced to convert it into kinetic energy and goes on to become electric energy. We will have a dynamo to help with that, this ensures we make full use of the energy we use hence longer distances.

* problem 3
POWER CONSUMPTION EFFICIENCY
Electric wheelchair are reliant on the electric energy stored to help move. With this new innovation, it helps the wheelchair utilize well it's stored energy. On slopes ,the wheelchair will make use of gravity ie free fall to propel the wheelchair downslope.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

LIMITATIONS

They can be cost prohibitive.

They are significantly heavier than manual wheelchairs. Due to there complex systems and adjustments made, it becomes heavier.

They are difficult to transport – you may require a customized vehicle. Unlike the old forms of wheelchairs which can be folded to become small and fit in small spaces, this will be transported as it is hence require storage that most vehicles don't have.

You'll need to be conscious of power usage. One has to consciously check the electric level and estimate of time to be used. This however useful, one can forget to check hence inconvenienced 

They require regular maintenance. Due to the high machine used, there needs to be regular checks so as to assess how well it's working to avoid it from breaking cause it's expensive to buy a new one.

Learning controls can be a learning curve. Unlike the conventional traditional wheelchairs, one needs lots of practise before being able to go long distances.
